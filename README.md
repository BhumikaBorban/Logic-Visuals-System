🚀 AlgoVisual: A Unified Algorithm Visualization Suite
AlgoVisual is an interactive web-based suite designed to help students and developers visualize complex data structures and algorithms in real-time.
By combining sorting, searching, and tree structures into a single unified dashboard, this project provides a "thought partner" experience for learning computer science fundamentals.

🌟 Modules at a Glance
1. Sorting Visualizer
Algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort.
Interactive Controls: Set custom arrays or generate random datasets.
Visual Logic: Bars change colors based on state: Scanning (Blue), Comparing (Red), Swapping (Yellow), and Sorted (Green).

2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
Dynamic Operations: Real-time insertion and deletion of nodes.
Traversals: Visualizes Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, and Level Order paths.
Smart Layout: An automated spacing logic ensures nodes are perfectly centered as the tree grows.

3. Binary Search
Step-by-Step Logic: Follow the Low, Mid, and High pointers as they narrow down the search space.
Status Logs: Detailed messages explain why the search moves left or right based on the middle element.

🛠 Technical Details
Core: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3.
Animations: Asynchronous sleep functions and CSS transitions provide smooth, human-readable motion.
Rendering: SVG for tree edges and dynamic DOM manipulation for array bars and tree nodes.
